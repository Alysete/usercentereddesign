<h1> Homework 2: Images</h1>
<h2> By: Alyssa Silver </h2>

<p> The purpose of the website is to inform members of Oil City Region Astronomical Society (ORAS) and non-members about ORAS events and general astronomy.</p>
<p>This website is aimed toward anybody interested in outer space. Either expert or new-be, this site is informational and educational.</p>
<p> The header photo: </p> <img src= "pano.jpg" alt="panorama"> </img> <p>I chose this photo as the header photo because it is a panorama. Panorama photography is great because it shows the most information. This particular panorama shows the observatory, which is a great introduction to ORAS because that's where the events take place. The event pictured (with the tents) is called "AstroBlast." This event is annual, it is a great representation of ORAS!</p>
<p> To enhance this photo from the original, I cropped out unnecessary information (telephone poles, trees, etc.) and used the rule of thirds by placing the observatory in the left side of the photo. After cropping, I adjusted the lighting to make the fog seem more dramatic. </p>
<p>The next three photos I chose to support my sight. Although all different, they aid at explaining the aim of the website and organization. </p>
 <img src= "group.jpg" alt= "Group Photo"> </img> <p>I added this photo to give a face to the name. These are the members of ORAS (circa 2011). These are the people who are heavily involved with the organization and are board members. I thought it would be a good idea to add this photo so the audience could see who's making ORAS possible. For this photo, first I cropped it to focus on the group. Then, I changed the colors and shadows to make everyone's skin tones more even, since there was a shadow in the original. </p>
 <img src= "nebula1.jpg" alt= "Nebula"> </img> <p>This nebula was taken with the ORAS telescope. It is important that I add this photo, not only because it's visually pleasing, but its also shows the legitimacy of this organization. At the observatory, its possible to see this nebula and a whole lot more of "space stuff." For editing, I did not have to do too much to enhance this photo. I cropped it because the nebula wasn't exactly center or to the left, I wanted to give it a definite place in the photo. In addition, I adjusted the contrast. This made the nebula, galaxies and stars pop.</p>
 <img src= "obsrainbow.jpg" alt= "Observatory rainbow"> </img> <p>I included this photo because it is a great photo of the actual observatory. It is a little more close up than the panorama, header photo. I thought it would be a clear photo to add to the site so visiters knows "where the magic happens." For editing, I made this photo brighter to make the rainbow and observatory pop out from the photo. </p>
<p> I got the photos and the permission to use them from Tim Spuck, President of ORAS. </p>
<p> The top five reasons I chose these photos was: </p>
<li> Quality: I wanted photos of good quality for my website, this attracts users and looks professional. </li>
<li> Reality: Everything and everyone in my photos look real. Especially in the group photo, where almost nobody is perfectly looking into the camera and smiling, but hey! that's real! </li>
<li> Unique: Space pictures can get monotonous and boring, but when one is from a telescope of the website's observatory, it's special looking at something so beautiful and original. </li>
<li> Cropped: Almost every single photo I posted has been cropped to focus on the main subject/subjects. This adds to each photo and get the reader to the point of what the photo's trying to tell you. </li>
<li> Human: It is easily spotted that these photos were taken by a human of real humans. </li>
<p> Another great example of photos that follow these criteria is: </p>
