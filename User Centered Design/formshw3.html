<h2> Homework 3, Forms Code Fix</h2>

<p> How I fixed this code document was first by pasting the source code into the W3C validator. After I found the errors, I went through one by one and corrected them. At times I wasn't sure how to fix the error, or I didn't understand the error description, so I googled it. If I found one mistake being repeated several times, for example not closing the input element or putting quotes around the values. XHTML is very strict with those rules. </p>
<p> After a few times of saving the document and uploading it back to the validator page, I got the errors under five. </p>
