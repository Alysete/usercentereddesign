<img src="martini.jpg" alt= "Beer" />
<p> I chose this picture of the martini glasses for several reasons. First, I found this photo was of higher quality than the photo of the beer.
When I resized it to 800px width, I thought it would be too small, but when I looked at it online, found it was not.
If the bar want's a classy presence online (and at the bar) then this photo wins. Either photo would look good on the web, depending on what feel the bar's going for (sports bar, or classy).
