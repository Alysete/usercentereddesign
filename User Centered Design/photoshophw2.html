<h2> Original Photo</h2>

<h2> Part 1: Crop</h2>

<p>First, I cropped the photo so less of the sky was showing. I purposefully left the photograph landscape to keep the rule of thirds in mind with the wooden path.  </p>

<h2> Part 2: Brightness/Contrast</h2>

<p>Second, I increased the brightness of the overall photo to achieve less shadows in the grassy area, then I added some contrast to get back the shadows in different areas, such as the refection on the water.</p>

<h2> Part 3: Variations</h2>

<p>Third, to play with the color a bit, I used the 'variations' tool. I was able to make the skye bluer and the grass greener. </p>

<h2> Part 4: Curve</h2>

<p>Lastly, I used the 'curve' tool to once again bring back some shadows in the grass area, as well as in the trees in the background. </p>
